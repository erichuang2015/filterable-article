Simply mark up your article in the following format and the plugin
will do the rest. Uses VueJS to create the parent row and categories.

```
[fa parent="Top Row of Buttons" cats="Second Row of Buttons"]
  content goes here
[/fa]

[fa parent="multiple,buttons that can be used,together"]
  content goes here
[/fa]
```
